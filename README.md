# front-end-project02

Hey Welcome to my Project!! I'm Gabriel Fernandes and I made this project during 3 days of learning.

ItÂ´s a Personal Site, mainly used to show some work and a little informations about a person;

Project Pages:
-Main Page (about.njk): Where is a bunch of info about the page owner and a menu, wich can leads to My GitHub and to my Videos on Youtube as well.
-Videos Page (portfolio.njk): A few videos that I made during quarentine to teach some knowledge that I got reading "Sapiens" by: Harari and "Make Time" By Jake Knapp.
-Video page (video.njk): A simple page to host the video wich the user can copy Url to share the video

I know sometimes may be sort of confusing just readind so I recorded the entire Procject down here, I hope you like.
